# Enron
The starter code for this exercise is [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects). The project consists in creating and training a
machine learning model to find persons that could have committed fraud using Enron's public dataset, containing emails and financial information
of some of the company's employees.

The goal for this project was to acquire some machine learning skills, including: implementing a supervised classification algorithm, use regression
algorithms to make predictions and identify and clean outliers, feature creation and selection to change raw features and identify the most
important features of the dataset, validation and evaluation for understanding and quantifying machine learning results.
